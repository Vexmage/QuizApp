    {
      "Id": 1,
      "Text": "What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and why is it important in a phased rollout strategy?",
      "Options": [
        "A) A fully-featured product that is released to the entire market.",
        "B) The initial version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters.",
        "C) A product that has all the features but is not yet tested.",
        "D) A prototype that is never released to the market."
      ],
      "CorrectOptionIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the initial version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters. It is important in a phased rollout strategy because it allows businesses to test their product concept with minimal resources and gather valuable user feedback before fully committing to the complete development."

        "B) User experience (UX) improvements",
        "C) Increasing page load times",
        "D) Analyzing user behavior"
      ],
      "CorrectOptionIndex": 2,
      "Explanation": "Increasing page load times is actually detrimental to Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). CRO focuses on improving user experience, conducting A/B testing, and analyzing user behavior to increase the percentage of visitors who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase."

      "CorrectOptionIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "In the context of an e-commerce platform, scalability refers to the platform's ability to handle an increasing number of users and transactions without compromising performance. This is crucial for supporting growth and ensuring a smooth user experience during traffic spikes."

      "Text": "Which of the following best describes a phased rollout?",
      "Options": [
        "A) Launching the full platform to all users at once.",
        "B) Gradually releasing the platform to different user groups over time.",
        "C) Rolling back the platform if there are too many bugs.",
        "D) Developing the platform in secret before announcing it to the public."
      ],
      "CorrectOptionIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "A phased rollout is a strategy where the platform or feature is gradually released to different user groups over time. This approach helps manage risk, allows for incremental testing, and provides opportunities to make adjustments based on feedback from early users before a full-scale launch."
